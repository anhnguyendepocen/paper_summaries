- Succinct, but not much clear.
- Use $f_i$ to do preference segmentation.

A very interesting and mathemetical approach.
- Figure 1 shows the competitive clout versus vulnerability for swithcing segments

##Kamakura et al. (1996)
- More clear:

Clearly state that how to allow for violations of the IIA property within each segment in proposed nested logit model (paragraph 2 in Abstract),
and four types of segments considered in the article (paragraph 3 in Abstract)
