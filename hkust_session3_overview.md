### Prof's Comments:

#### 1. Two approach of heterogeneity:
- **random coefficient** (3.2)
- **finite discrete model** (3.1, 3.3, 3.4): evaluate AIC, choose the one with smallest AIC.

#### 2. Different types of heterogeneity:
- **Observed**. e.g. income, loyalty
- **Unobserved**. e.g. random coefficient

#### 3. When doing optimization, make sure that the function need to maximized has no constraint. Otherwise, the optimization will be very difficult.

### 3.1 Kamakura and Russell (1989)
- Succinct, but not much clear.
- Use $f_i$ to do preference segmentation.

A very interesting and mathemetical approach.
- Figure 1 shows the competitive clout versus vulnerability for switching segments

### 3.2 Gonul and Srinivasan (1993)
- Not only consider consumer segmentation (loyalty and switching), but also add random components to intercepts and parameters.

The first and the third paper both only consider different approaches of consumer segmentation.

### 3.3 Kamakura et al. (1996)
- More clear:

Clearly state that how to allow for violations of the IIA property within each segment in proposed nested logit model (paragraph 2 in Abstract), and four types of segments considered in the article (paragraph 3 in Abstract)
- Identify two forms of heterogeneity in consumer brand choice: preference heterogeneiry and structural heterogeneity. (P153)
- This model can be viewed as a generation of the model in first paper (Kamakura and Russell, 1989). (P154)
- Point out that Kamakura and Russell (1989) didn't use all the available information, may lead to biased and inefficient estimates. (P156 last paragraph)

### 3.4 Keane (1997)
- Determine whether heterogeneity or **state dependence** or both are important.
