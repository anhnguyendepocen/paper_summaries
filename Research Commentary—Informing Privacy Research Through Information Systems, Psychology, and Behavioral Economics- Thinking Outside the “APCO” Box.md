##Introduction
“Antecedents–Privacy Concerns–Outcomes” (APCO), reflects the assumption of "responses to external stimuli result in deliberate analyses, which lead to fully informed privacy-related attitudes and behaviors".

Sometimes behaviors are emotion-laden, spontaneous, or performed without complete information. Prior work on information privacy has rarely accounted for these types of behaviors, and the processes involved in such biased, incomplete decision making and information processing have not been considered.

###Levels of Effort Nomenclature
Throughout this commentary, we refer to “high-effort” and “low-effort” cognitive processing.

**Elaboration likelihood model:**

- central route
People form, change, and act on their attitudes through a **high-effort** process that is elaborated, consciously determined, logical, and explainable.
- peripheral route
Involves relatively little cognitive effort or conscious awareness, reflecting **low-effort** cognitive processing

Modern psychological theories focus on a continuum ranging from high-effort to low-effort processing of stimuli, avoiding the binary treatment resulting from “rational–irrational” terminology.

Original APCO model relies on high-effort cognitive processing.

##The Original APCO Model
Each of these macromodels assumes that individuals reflect **thoughtfully** and **deliberately** on their behaviors involving privacy options; however, none of these macromodels considers the nontrivial impact of low-effort thinking and extraneous influence of default heuristic processes and biases when a decision is made.

Important considerations, such as one’s emotional state or cognitive biases (Goes 2013), are overlooked by these macromodels.

##The Enhanced APCO Model
The upper “cloud” represents a set of situational and cognitive limitations that determines the level of effort of processing.

The lower “cloud” represents important extraneous influences that have been identified by the fields of behavioral economics and psychology: biases, heuristics, and misattributions that directly influence privacy-related attitudes and behaviors without much intention, awareness, or cognitive effort.

###Level of Effort and the APCO Relationships
Low-effort processing involves relatively little cognitive effort or conscious awareness; that is, behavior-relevant information is evaluated by means of simple and relatively automatic cognitive heuristics and mental shortcuts that are based on past experiences, habits, routines, inertia (Polites and Karahanna 2012, 2013), or spontaneous reactions rather than on effortful analysis involving logic and elaborated reasoning.

In the enhanced APCO model, the level of effort
determines the extent to which original APCO relations are weaker or stronger.

Because the specific moderating effect (strengthening or weakening) cannot be predicted in absolute terms a priori for each relationship, further empirical research will be needed to address the exact ways in which level of effort mod- ifies the APCO relationships.

Proposition M1. *The level of effort employed in processing information regarding privacy-related decisions moderates the APCO relationships in forming privacy-related attitudes and behaviors.*

###Cognitive Resources and Affect as Drivers of Level of Effort

**Information Overload and Limited Cognitive Resources.**

Proposition P1. *People with reduced cognitive re-
sources or who are cognitively taxed will be more likely to engage in low-effort processing.*

**Affect: Implications of Emotion and Mood.**
intense positive emotions (e.g., elation, physical arousal) also reduce cognitive expenditures, making it more likely that people will rely on shortcuts such as heuris- tics and stereotypes (Ariely and Loewenstein 2006, Loewenstein 1996) than on more effortful processes (e.g., deliberation, individuation).

Proposition P2. *Current intense emotions and moods
can impact the level of effort associated with cognitive processing.*

**Time Constraints and Need for Cognition.**

Proposition P3. *Time constraints can invoke low-effort
processing.*

Proposition P4. *A higher need for cognition invokes high-effort processing, whereas a lower need for cognition invokes low-effort processing.*

###Extraneous Influences: Peripheral Cues, Biases, Heuristics, and Misattribution Effects
**Peripheral Cue: Message Framing.**

Proposition D1. *Message framing acts as a peripheral
cue and can impact the APCO model constructs.*

**Endowment and Related Biases.**

Proposition D2. *The endowment effect, loss aversion,
and zero-cost bias can impact the APCO model constructs. Implicit.*

**Implicit Trust and Positivity Biases.**

Proposition D3. *Default trust and positivity bias can
impact the APCO model constructs.*

**Optimistic Bias and “Yes” Bias.**

Proposition D4. *The optimistic and “yes” biases can
impact the APCO model constructs.*

**Source Variables.**

Source variables include message-unrelated factors involving the source of a solicitation, such as perceived expertise, attractiveness, likability, power and authority, and other characteristics of the communicator.

Proposition D5. *Source variables, such as attractive-
ness, perceived authority, or perceived trustworthiness, can impact the APCO model constructs.*

**Misattribution Effects.**

Misattributions occur when a person incorrectly ascribes an experience to a perceived cause and acts in accordance with this incorrect understanding of the situation.

Proposition D6. *Misattribution can impact the APCO
model constructs.*

**Anchoring.**

Proposition D7. *Anchoring people’s choices to arbitrary coherence can impact the APCO model constructs.*

**Herding Effect.**

Proposition D8. *Herding effects can impact the APCO model constructs.*

##Rethinking APCO
Many of the postulated relations in the enhanced APCO model are most appropriately tested in laboratory experiments, which, because of the need for controls and designed treatments.

Just as with the original APCO model, the enhanced model is best viewed as a macromodel that can guide research over a significant period of time.

Note, however, that tasks requiring organizational or political understanding are often **inappropriate for student subjects**, even in controlled experiments, because students cannot be expected to fully comprehend the scenarios and treatments.
