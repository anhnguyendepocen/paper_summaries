##Preference Building Effects

(correspond to the "Preferences" part in "Basic concepts and research findings" in paper "Behavioral economics: Past, present, future")

Behavioral economists have shown that preferences are not the clear-cut set of preference curves microeconomics teaches us. They are extremely context-dependent and **are subject to strong cognitive effects or biases**. When making decisions, people go through a process of “building” their preferences. Framing, anchoring, and endowment are some of the cognitive biases that have been identified, which heavily influence the construction of preferences.

###Framing
The way choices are presented (framed) to individuals often determines the preference that is elicited.

###Anchoring
This effect relates to how the mind is biased by first impressions. Anchoring occurs when individuals use an initial piece of information to make subsequent judgments.

###Endowment
Classical economic theory asserts that the value a person attaches to a good doesn’t depend on its ownership by the person. In other words, the willingness to pay (WTP) for a good should be equal to the willingness to accept (WTA) if property ownership has been established.

##Behavioral Economics and IS Research
###Recommendation and Personalization Systems
The massive amounts of information available to consumers at the decision point can lead to information overload, which can result in greater reliance on heuristics and greater susceptibility to biases in economic decision making. 

There is a huge opportunity here for combining IS research methods (explanatory, predictive, experimentation) with behavioral economics principles to shed light on the issues and inform design science research.

###Online Actions and E-Marketplaces
Online auction research can be further expanded by exploring cognitive biases introduced by the way information is presented in the auction sites, framing from available information from other sites and search engines, as well as the endowment effect present during auction negotiations.

###Loss Aversion and Prospect Theory
The endowment effect is a good example of biases related to loss aversion. These are explained very well by prospect theory (Kahneman and Tversky 1979): the disutility of loss of x is worse than the utility of an equal size gain of x.

###Collective Intelligence and Gamification
Fast evolving Internet technologies have brought about a variety of new applications, marketplaces, and business models, in which the “crowd” plays an important role.

To maintain engagement by participants, many sites have resorted to gamification ideas, one of which relates to giving “badges” or certifications to different levels of voluntary contribution.

###Time Discounting
What behavioral economists have found in laboratories and through observational data is that, in reality, the discounting follows more a hyperbolic function rather than an exponential one.

###Privacy and Security
For example, individuals are willing to trade off privacy for convenience, or bargain the release of very personal information for immediate rewards such as coupons or prizes.

##Conclusion
Initially the discipline relied **solely on experiments**, but then started to test the early findings against **observational data**. IS researchers are experts in collecting and assembling large observational datasets off Internet applications. These datasets provide a valuable source for testing and advancing behavioral economics theories. **Field experiments provide a middle ground between labs and observational data**; the Internet and its various IT-mediated environments provide great opportunities for field experiments.

Behavioral economics has reinforced the point that the **context** matters in how the cognitive effects influence the choices.

###Two unexplored directions

Two important and relatively unexplored directions along which behavioral economics and IS can travel together:

1. Measuring social influence. Adding the social dimension to the judgment and decision context.
2. Neural sciences.
