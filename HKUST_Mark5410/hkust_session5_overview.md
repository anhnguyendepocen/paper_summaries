- Consider three part and combine them together: viewer, advertiser, and network.
- Use market-level data to to estimate demand. (BLP)
- Considering both demand and supply side, price is endogenous. But in this paper, we only model this on the demand side (assuming price is exdogenous).
- This paper estimate the three part one by one (step by step). However, a more ideal practice is integrate them together and perform a full information approach.

- Combining promotion with current quantity, interpurchase time, and previous household inventory.
- Two equations (Q and E) both use $I_{c-1}$, OLS estimation will be biased, and includes lagged values of endogenous variables. Instrument variables and 2SLS are used.
- Use calibration and holdout dataset to do validation.

- Prove that using market-level data will induce aggregation bias. Because marketing effects (e.g. promotion) might have different influence on stores (heterogeneity).
- Introduce a debiasing procedure.

- Results: In the long run, advertising has "good" effects and promotions have "bad" effects on consumers' brand choice behavior.
