## Introduction

### Prevailing marketing theory
The proportion of winners in a contest should always be lower than the proportion of losers.

This theory is based on the assumption that contestants care solely about the value of the prizes they receive.

### Behavioral economics model (Social Comparison Model)

If contestants also care about their contest outcomes relative to other contestants, changing the proportion of winners in a contest can alter the **reference points** contestants use to make these **social comparisons**. Consequently, **a contest with a higher proportion of winners than losers can yield greater effort** than one with fewer winners than losers if the degree of social loss aversion in the contestants is sufficiently strong.

The modeling approach offers the advantage of **generating point predictions of contestants' effort levels**, which makes it possible to benchmark the predictions of the social comparison model against the self-interested model quantitatively.

## Social Comparison Model

$\alpha$ and $\beta$ are **social preference parameters**.

Assume $U_i(Win) = P_W + \alpha\times(P_W-P_{Mode})$ and $U_i(Lose) = P_L + \beta\times(P_L-P_{Mode})$. First, $\alpha$ can be either positive or negative; a value of $\alpha>0$ captures the status-seeking preferences for winning relative to the typical contestant, and $\alpha<0$ captures the aversion or guilt that results from coming out ahead of others. Second, $\beta>0$ because contestants dislike losing relative to others, and $\beta>\alpha$, which reflects social loss aversion.

$P_1$: Let $m_L<(N/2)<m_H$. Equilibrium effort in the high-winners contest is greater than that in the low-winners contest if $\beta>[(1+\alpha)(m_H/m_L)]-1$. Otherwise, effort in the low-winners contest is greater.

### Alternative Models of Social Comparison
- Reference point is the **average value** of all prizes?

The effort level of high winners situation is higher than the effort level of low winners only when $\alpha<-1$. In other words, contestants must dislike earning more than the average value of prizes to such an extent that they would forgo receiving a larger winner's prize $P_W$. This preference is  probably **not plausible** in contests among peers.

## Experiment (remain to be done)
### Experiment 1
(point estimation of parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$)


### Experiment 2

## Feelings about this paper
### Pros
- Point estimation of social preference parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
- Test robustness of social parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ across experimental contexts.
- Consider multiple alternative assumptions and models, provide cites and analysis on them.
### Cons
- Use survey and follow-up experiment to investigate the effect of experimental settings.
