##Six behavioral economics models and their applications to marketing

###1. Reference dependence
**Reference dependence**: Decision makers care about changes in outcomes as well as the final outcomes themselves.

**Loss aversion**: They are more sensitive to changes that are coded as losses (relative to a reference point) than to equal-sized changes that are perceived as gains.

A classic example that demonstrates `reference dependence` and `loss aversion` is the “**endowment effect**” experiment.

Endowing a person with an object shifts his or her reference point to a state of ownership, and the difference in valuations demonstrates that the disutility of losing a mug is greater than the utility of gaining it.

**Elasticities** are larger for price increases than for decreases.
