##A recipe that many lines of research in behavior economics have followed
1. Identify normative assumptions or models that are ubiquitously used by economists, such as Bayesian updating, expected utility and discounted utility.
2. Identify anomalies—i.e., demonstrate clear violations of the assumption or model, and painstakingly rule out alternative explanations (such as subjects’ confusion or transactions costs).
3. Use the anomalies as inspiration to create alternative theories that generalize existing models.
4. Construct economic models of behavior using the behavioral assumptions from the third step, derive fresh implications, and test them. (This final step has only been taken more recently but is well represented in this volume of advances.)

##Basic concepts and research findings
The field of Behavioral Decision Research, on which behavioral economics has drawn more than any other subfield of psychology, typically classifies research into two categories: **judgment** and **choice**.

- judgment -> estimate probabilites
- choice -> select among actions

###Probability judgment
####Standard approaches
The standard principles used in economics to model probability judgment in economics are concepts of **statistical sampling**, and **Bayes’ rule** for updating probabilities in the face of new evidence. Bayes’ rule is unlikely to be correct descriptively because it has several features that are cognitively unrealistic. 

**First**, Bayesian updating requires a prior. **Second**, Bayesian updating requires a separation between previously-judged probabilities and evaluations of new evidence. But many cognitive mechanisms use previous information to filter or interpret what is observed, violating this separability. **Third**, subjective expected utility assumes separability between probability judgments of states and utilities which result from those states. **Fourth**, the Bayesian updating predicts no effects of the order of arrival of information.

####Cognitive approaches
Cognitive psychologists have proposed **heuristic mechanisms** that will lead to judgments which sometimes violate either sampling principles or Bayes’ rule.

- availability heuristic
- representativeness

Many studies explore these heuristics and replicate their "biases" in applied domains. It is important to note that a "heuristic" is both a good thing and a bad thing.

**quasi-Bayesian approach**: the Bayesian model is embedded as a special case, which allows theoretical insight and empirical tests about how well the Bayesian restriction fits.

###Preferences: Revealed, constructed, discovered, or learned?
- framing effects
positive/negative effects
- anchoring effect
The classic demonstration of an anchoring effect (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974, and in this volume) was identified **in the context of judgment rather than choice**.
- context effects

All of the above findings suggest that preferences are not the pre-defined sets of indifference curves represented in microeconomics textbooks.
