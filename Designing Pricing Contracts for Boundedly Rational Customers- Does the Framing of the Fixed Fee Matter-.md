##Introduction

###Context
manufacturer-retailer channel

**Figure 1 A Taxonomy of Pricing Contracts Fixed**
|----| Fixed fee not charged | Fixed fee charged Number |
|----|-----------------------|--------------------------|
|Number of marginal prices = 1|Linear-price contract|Two-part tariff (Quantity discount)|
|Number of marginal prices >1|Block tariff|Three-part tariff

###Standard economic theories
1. The introduction of the fixed fee restores channel
efficiency to the level of the **integrated channel**. (Channel efficiency **increases** with the introduction of the **fixed fee**)
2. Channel outcomes are invariant to the framing of
the fixed fee. Specifically, a two-part tariff and a quantity discount achieve the same channel outcomes.

**“Double-marginalization” problem**(Spengler 1950): 
This inefficiency occurs in an **independent channel** because neither firm takes into account the externality its pricing decision imposes on the other’s profit. Consequently, both charge a higher price than if they were part of the integrated channel.

###Phenomenon
1. The introduction of the fixed fee fails to increase channel efficiency. 
2. Moreover, the framing of the fixed fee does make a difference: an opaque frame as quantity discounts achieves higher channel efficiency than a salient frame as a two-part tariff, although these two contractual formats are theoretically equivalent.

###Improvement
1. **Reference dependent**. Generalize the standard economic model by allowing the retailer’s utilities to be reference dependent so that the up-front fixed fee payment is perceived as a loss and the subsequent retail profits as a gain. 
In two-part tariff framing, the up-front fixed fee can register as a loss and the subsequent retail proceeds a gain. These two mental accounts may thus be given different utility weights, as measured by the **loss-aversion coefficient**.
2. **Decision mistakes**. Embed this reference-dependent utility function in a **quantal response equilibrium framework** where the retailer is allowed to make decision mistakes due to computational complexity.

###Key prediction
Channel efficiency decreases with loss aversion for sufficiently Nash-rational retailers. 

loss aversion dominates complexity aversion in explaining the data.
